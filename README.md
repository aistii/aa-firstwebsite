# appAcademy Open | First Website!
For appAcademy Open's first capstone project (HTML and CSS Capstone Project)!
This involves:
- Building four pages:
  - All with a _navigation bar_;
  - One page acting as an "article";
  - One page acting as a field (no submission function, however; this is to test out knowledge of HTML and CSS);
  - One page of lists that link to other websites;
  - and one page that uses a layout to organize images into a grid

## My Topic (updated)
🧋 ___Boba!___

For this static website, I wanted to create a mock website for a boba chain; I used to work at various ones but I thought it'd be fun to create a fictional one.

In order of the pages listed above:
- The first page will act as a home page
- The second page will act as a contact form
- The third page will act as a list of locations
- The fourth page will look something like a menu
