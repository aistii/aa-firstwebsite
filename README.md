# appAcademy Open | First Website!
For appAcademy Open's first capstone project (HTML and CSS Capstone Project)!
This involves:
- Building four pages:
  - All with a _navigation bar_;
  - One page acting as an "article";
  - One page acting as a field (no submission function, however; this is to test out knowledge of HTML and CSS);
  - One page of lists that link to other websites;
  - and one page that uses a layout to organize images into a grid

## My Topic
🔮 ___Mygan-X!___

For this static website, I've decided to delve in on some of the worldbuilding aspects I've been working on for my stories.

This one is specifically about the various properties of "Mygan-X", which is my fictional world's take on "MP" or "_mana_" in other fantasy settings.

I've written a great deal on it, but I believe it's time for me to actually publish some of that information. It will be good for my friends who are reading my manuscripts I've written! The manuscripts don't go too deep into the workings because I want to keep it fun, but this supplementary website will be good for them if they're interested in learning more.

## Story Info
This isn't pertinent to the project, but visiting [my website in the novel-writing section](https://leannagarner.com/#novel-writing) will provide a short description of the books. Take a look if you're interested!

I plan to eventually develop my own theme for Wordpress since I've been using it on-and-off since 2014 (for a gaming blog in the past), so I'm very excited to see what progress I'll make during my adventure going through appAcademy Open's curriculum.
